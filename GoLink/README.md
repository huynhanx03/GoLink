This folder contains API collections managed by [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/). These collections serve as a testing suite and documentation for the project's APIs.

To get started:
1. Install the Bruno app.
2. Open Bruno and select **Open Collection**.
3. Point to this directory (`GoLink/GoLink`).
4. Select an environment (e.g., `dev`) to configure usage, and you can start testing requests immediately.
